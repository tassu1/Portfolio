            Hey, I’m Tahseen – a curious and determined Computer Science student, always eager to learn new things and push my limits. I’m diving deep into the MERN stack and just beginning my exploration into AI. I thrive on solving real-world problems, and I approach every challenge as a learning opportunity. With projects like SmartCall and Sports Safari under my belt, I’m excited to create more innovative solutions. I'm not a master yet, but my enthusiasm and ability to pick up new concepts quickly keep me going. Whether it’s coding, building, or experimenting with new ideas, I’m always open to learning, adapting, and growing.
